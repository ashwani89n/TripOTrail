TripOTrail is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the trip management process for travelers, covering two key phases: Planning and Tracking. In the Planning phase, users can easily add destinations, create timelines, and establish budgets. The platform leverages APIs to help discover attractions, accommodations, and dining options, while also allowing users to upload essential documents and set reminders. Collaborative planning features enable travelers to invite others, ensuring that all preferences are considered. During the Tracking phase, TripOTrail offers real-time monitoring of planned activities and provides a detailed overview of the trip after completion, including locations, accommodations, and expenses. An advanced expense tracking system simplifies bill-splitting among participants.
